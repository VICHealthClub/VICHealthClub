# Welcome to the VIC Health Club

The VIC Health Club is a club for United Nations staff working at the Vienna International Centre, established since 1995. The Club aims to provide activities that improve the health and well-being of members by reducing mental and physical stress. To this end, we currently offer services, such as massage therapy, yoga classes, and tai chi classes.
